# Apply Autofilter to Excel Range using Python (xlwings)

This code is an example of applying an `autofilter` to an Excel spreadsheet using Python.
In particular, I am using xlwings. Keep in mind, xlwings in version 0.25.3 DOES NOT NATIVELY SUPPORT `autofilter`.
Therefore, I am using the underlying API as a workaround. Apart from looking ugly, keep in mind that it makes your code platform-specific (!).
This code works only on Windows.

## Requirements
```
xlwings==0.25.3
openpyxl==3.0.9
pandas==1.3.5
```
